            <li><strong>Self-Driving Stack:</strong> i. Implementing an out-of-distribution detection model by using energy score as a metric to an object detection dataset in the self-driving Domain.<br> ii. Implementing a new uncertainity metric as a method of evaluation for motion planning. This method once verified can be extended towards prediction, mapping and localization.<br>  <strong>[Current Research]</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Diffusion Models for Point Process:</strong> Currently developing diffusion models for point dataset to recreate certain paths in a high dimensional space using an unconditional framework where the number of points are unknown. <br> <strong>[Current Research]</strong></li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Jailbreaking Language Models:</strong> Developed several techniques to jailbreak LLAMA2 (7B and 13B) model to answer harmful questions from the AdvBenchDataset.
